## A brief introduction to the MCRLdata Sandbox!

Hi! If you're reading this, this is likely your first time visiting the MCRLdata Sandbox. A broad overview and general tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md). This introduction will focus on more specific explanations of to use this sandbox. 

The MCRLdata Sandbox is a Github Organization. Github is an open-source platform that uses version-control software called Git to allow for multiple folks to work on code at the same time. It's also a great venue for keeping track of data, figures, and code while allowing multiple people to access it. A Github Organization is are shared accounts that can host many projects at once. In this case, since the goal of the MCRLdata Sandbox is to give all folks who want it easy access to a growing suite of MCRLdata-related tools, and the ability to develop their own tools and share them with others. The [MCRLdata-Sandbox](https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox) Github Organization contains a number of Github repositories, each of which contains code, data, and other things related to a specific goal. The core repos are: 

1. data_prep - tools for cleaning up data to different quality control levels which are used by other repos
2. data_retrieval - on-demand data access
3. data_sandbox - a collection of tools to help users get more out of MCRLdata resources
4. [tutorials](https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox/tutorials) - step-by-step instructions from getting started to advanced analyses

If you are not sure where to start, I suggest starting with [tutorials](https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox/tutorials):
